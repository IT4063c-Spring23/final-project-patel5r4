# # Does the vehicle type affect the chances of rollover and injury?üìù

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# I think the bigger the vehicle, the safer it is on the road. However, bigger vehicle like SUVs and trucks are believed to be more likely to rollover than passenger cars. But that may not necessarily mean that the accidents will always be fatal. Some data even says that the rollover rates for SUVs are declining (article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217479/). 
# 
#    

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Although certain road and traffic conditions increase the likelihood of fatal accidents, does it matter what type of vehicle are we driving? Are there more rollover chances for SUVs than cars?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# A hypothesized answer will be - SUVs are more likely to rollover due to their design (they are generally taller and narrower), but the rates are declining and the accidents are not always fatal.   

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# 1. https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/passenger-vehicle-occupants?_gl=1*1t3lna3*_ga*YW1wLU5uWExTOC00UnpJamxTZ2M5RlNOUEE.#fn1ref1 
# 
# This webpage has multiple data tables on death and rollover rates by vehicle type. 
# 
# 2. https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/809438 
# 
# This documnent has data tables that show the number of rollovers by vehicle type.
# 
# 3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/nhtsa-traffic-fatalities?select=vehicle_2016 
# 
# This dataset is from Kaggle - it has traffic fatality records.  
# 
# 

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# These sources have data about crashes, deaths and rollovers. These can be merged together - for example, total crashes and rollover by vehicle type will show what type of vehicle is most likely to rollover and if the SUV rollover rates are really declining.

# ## Summary

# - From the analysis, it looks like cars are more likely to rollover than SUVs and trucks.
# - The chances of SUV (and also for vans) rollovers increase when they are not speeding (which sounds odd!). 
# - Cars rollover rates are declining.
# - In all rollovers, the fatality rates are higher for frontal initial impact point. 
# - 
# - Also, (forgot to mention earlier), the reason I came up with this topic: personal experience few months back when I almost crashed into the vehicles ahead of mine, not once, but twice on the same day at different locations in NJ! Likely due to overspeeding on completely unfamiliar roads and traffic conditions - though everything was fine (except for my vehicle's sensors screaming at me!).
